<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Speaks a phrase over the vehicle audio system using SDL&rsquo;s TTS (text-to-speech) engine. The provided text to be spoken can be simply a text phrase, or it can consist of phoneme specifications to direct SDL&rsquo;s TTS engine to speak a <q>speech-sculpted</q> phrase.</p>

<p>Receipt of the Response indicates the completion of the Speak operation, regardless of how the Speak operation may have completed (i.e. successfully, interrupted, terminated, etc.).</p>

<p>Requesting a new Speak operation while the application has another Speak operation already in progress (i.e. no corresponding Response for that in-progress Speak operation has been received yet) will terminate the in-progress Speak operation (causing its corresponding Response to be sent by SDL) and begin the requested Speak operation</p>

<p>Requesting a new Speak operation while the application has an <i>SDLAlert</i> operation already in progress (i.e. no corresponding Response for that in-progress <i>SDLAlert</i> operation has been received yet) will result in the Speak operation request being rejected (indicated in the Response to the Request)</p>

<p>Requesting a new <i>SDLAlert</i> operation while the application has a Speak operation already in progress (i.e. no corresponding Response for that in-progress Speak operation has been received yet) will terminate the in-progress Speak operation (causing its corresponding Response to be sent by SDL) and begin the requested <i>SDLAlert</i> operation</p>

<p>Requesting a new Speak operation while the application has a <i>SDLPerformInteraction</i> operation already in progress (i.e. no corresponding Response for that in-progress <i>SDLPerformInteraction</i> operation has been received yet) will result in the Speak operation request being rejected (indicated in the Response to the Request)</p>

<p>Requesting a <i>SDLPerformInteraction</i> operation while the application has a Speak operation already in progress (i.e. no corresponding Response for that in-progress Speak operation has been received yet) will terminate the in-progress Speak operation (causing its corresponding Response to be sent by SDL) and begin the requested <i>SDLPerformInteraction</i> operation</p>

<p>HMI Status Requirements:
 <li>HMILevel: FULL, Limited</li>
 <li>AudioStreamingState: Any</li>
 <li>SystemContext: MAIN, MENU, VR</li></p>

<p><b>Notes:</b>
 <li>When <i>SDLAlert</i> is issued with MENU in effect, <i>SDLAlert</i> is queued and <q>played</q> when MENU interaction is completed (i.e. SystemContext reverts to MAIN). When <i>SDLAlert
 </i> is issued with VR in effect, <i>SDLAlert</i> is queued and <q>played</q> when VR interaction is completed (i.e. SystemContext reverts to MAIN)</li>
 <li>When both <i>SDLAlert</i> and Speak are queued during MENU or VR, they are <q>played</q> back in the order in which they were queued, with all existing rules for <q>collisions</q> still in effect</li></p>

<p><b>Additional Notes:</b>
 <li>Total character limit depends on platform.</li>
 <li>Chunks are limited to 500 characters; however you can have multiple TTS chunks.</li>
 <li>On old systems there is a total character limit of 500 characters across all chunks. This could vary according to the VCA.</li></p>
